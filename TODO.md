## TODOs
1. include the runners as binaries (perhaps even merge them)
3. handle after_connect/setup errors
4. rethink ack logic on errors
5. logging/logger into config file
6. --id for the runner in config file (better recognition in process list)
7. unbind automagically if queue is bound to more then specified keys
8. care abount messages with "old" routing keys
